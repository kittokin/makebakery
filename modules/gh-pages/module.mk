# NOTE: The GNU Make manual says,
#
# "Recursive make commands should always use the variable MAKE, not the
# explicit command name ‘make’" (5.7.1)
#
# Unfortunately, there seems to be a feature where the toplevel Makefile will
# not clean up its intermediate files until sub-makes have completed execution.
# That's undesired behavior in this case.

	# Ensuring there are no uncommitted changes in the current branch:
	git status -s
	[ -z "$$(git status -s)" ] || ( echo "Error: commit or stash local changes first." && false )
	# Ensuring local gh-pages branch exists here:
	git show-ref refs/heads/gh-pages
	# Ensuring local gh-pages branch is not currently checked out here:
	[ "$$(git symbolic-ref HEAD)" != "refs/heads/gh-pages" ]

	[ "$$(git -C $(DST) symbolic-ref HEAD)" = "refs/heads/gh-pages" ]
	make # Why not $(MAKE)? See NOTE above.
	# This pushes the gh-pages branch that we updated in DST back into our own
	# local repo, not our upstream. It's still up to us to push to GitHub after
	# this.
