# License: AGPL-3.0+ with additional permissions

This software is released under the terms of the [GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) (or at your option, any later version.)

## Grant of Additional Permission

The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of the files typically output by this software under terms of the recipient's choice.

You have permission to propagate output of this software, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of AGPLv3. However, if by modifying this software you cause any non-template part of the version you received to be output from your modified version, then you void this Exception for the resulting covered work. If you convey that resulting covered work, you must remove this Exception in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 7 of AGPLv3.

## Plain-Language Summary

If you redistribute this software, modified or verbatim, it must be AGPL-licensed. If you incorporate some or all of it into other software, that software must be AGPL-licensed.

If you somehow modify it to run as a service, or incorporate parts of it into a service, you still have to release all the code to your users, under the AGPL-3.0 license.

The included templates are covered by the AGPL too. If you modify those for use in your own project, your project must be AGPL-licensed. But the output HTML, Javascript, etc. is exempt; you may license it however you like.

You could, for example, use this software to create a tech blog where all the code you publish is permissively-licensed or even kept proprietary "all rights reserved."

Given those rules, someone might consider a clever loophole: if you create a template which embeds all of this software in its output, then this software would generate a copy of itself not covered by the AGPL. So, the license tediously states that no, you are not allowed to do that nasty thing.

The `demo-src` part of this repository includes template code from compatibly-licensed projects:

- [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/), original license: Expat ("MIT")
- [jQuery](http://jquery.org), original license: Expat ("MIT")

The availability of this Exception does not release you from the requirements of those licenses: regardless of the terms you choose, you must include original authors' copyright notices and license text.
