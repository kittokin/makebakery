<h1 class="title">About <em>Make</em></h1>
</header>
<p><em>Make</em> is a build tool that figures out which commands need to be run to transform some given set of source files into a desired set of output files. Modern work-alikes include [Grunt][], [Rake][], or [Ant][]. Despite its age and the number of times it has been re-invented, <em>Make</em> has some surprising features that I think makes it superior to the newcomers:</p>
<ul>
<li>When invoked multiple times, it is smart enough to only recompile target files whose source files have changed.</li>
<li>When used on multi-core systems or with I/O heavy jobs, it is smart enough to figure out how to parallelize its work.</li>
<li><em>Make</em> can apply multiple compilation steps to each source file to render the desired output, and it cleans up the intermediate files automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Make</em> has a rather steep learning curve, but since it is so ubiquitous, it’s likely to be already installed on your computer, and your web host’s servers, and easy to obtain if not.</p>
<p><em>Make</em> is a POSIX standard, but Makebakery relies on a specific implementation with non-standard features: [GNU Make][]. Why?</p>
<p>Mostly because that’s what is installed on all my computers, all of which run Debian GNU/Linux. It’s Free Software so it’s not difficult to get running on other platforms. Making a similar system based on POSIX <em>Make</em> or [Plan 9’s Mk][Mk] might be possible, but it’s not a high priority for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the POSIX standard version of Make is extraordinarily feature-poor; it lacks many basic functions that people need in practice. As a result, most people create makefiles (the input files to make) that require specific implementations instead of just following the POSIX standard. Typically that specific implementation is GNU make; since GNU make runs on nearly every Unix-like system, and is FLOSS, this is an easy requirement to meet.</p>
