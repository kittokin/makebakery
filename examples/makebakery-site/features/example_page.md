This page demonstrates that a source file which contains pure Markdown and
nothing more will be correctly converted to HTML, wrapped in the template, and
rendered to the output location. There are no markers, no calls to M4 macros,
and no boilerplate.

If you don't need to get fancy, your source files can stay nice and free of
markup, code, and macro calls.

# Here's a subheading

Here's another paragraph. "Here's a sentence in quotes---containing em
dashes---to demonstrate pandoc's 'smart quotes' feature."
