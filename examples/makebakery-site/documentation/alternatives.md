It has been said that every programmer, at some point, writes a blog/website publishing engine.

# Other Make-based approaches

These projects also use `make` in some capacity for building static sites:

- [chrisman/m4-blog](https://github.com/chrisman/m4-blog) combines make, pandoc, and gnu m4 to generate [Chrisman Brown's blog](). It is similar to what I used to do before makebakery.

- [technomancy.us](https://technomancy.us/) Phil Hagelberg a.k.a. technomancy publishes his site using "GNU M4, rsync, and a 12-line Makefile."
  Technomancy is also the creator of [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) (which I use every day) and the [Atreus keyboard](https://atreus.technomancy.us/) (I own both a classic atreus and a keyboardio atreus.)

# Other static site generators

- [staticsitegenerators.net](https://staticsitegenerators.net) is a crowdsourced directory containing a myriad of static site generators.

- [Haunt](https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html), implemented in Guile Scheme.

- [Coleslaw](https://github.com/redline6561/coleslaw), implemented in Common Lisp.

- [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), implemented in Python.

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)'s [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org) promotes an architecture combining static sites with client-side Javascript use of APIs, and includes a directory of [Jamstack-compatible site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/).
